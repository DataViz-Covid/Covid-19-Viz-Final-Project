        This graph is a scatter plot that represents the total number of cases of covid for each country based on its population density. The countries are color coded based on their continents, and hovering over the legend will show the data of this particular continent alone.

It begins with zero cases prior to covid and gradually increases. As shown by the line graphs, the hospitality rate has one peak that corresponds to the second peak of the cases line. As the pointer moves along the lines, more information on accurate numbers for each of these measures will be displayed. Because the ranges of the two graphs differ, there are two y axes provided for each. As a result, we can compare the flactuations of two graphs using this plot, but for the exact number, we should point to a specific point to get more information.
